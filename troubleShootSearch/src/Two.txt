Hard Disk Drives, or HDD in techno-parlance, have been around for donkey's years relative to the technology world.
HDDs were first introduced by IBM in 1956 - yes folks this is nearly 60-year old technology, thank goodness vacuum tubes for TVs didn’t last so long. 
An HDD uses magnetism to store data on a rotating platter. 
A read/write head floats above the spinning platter reading and writing data. 
The faster the platter spins, the faster an HDD can perform. 
Typical laptop drives today spin at either 5400 RPM (Revolutions per Minute) or 7200RPM, though some server-based platters spin at up to 15,000 RPM.
