A pen drive is nothing but a portable storage space device which is capable of taking care of your storage requirements. 
Of course, back in the days, these devices weren’t able to hold more than a hundred megabytes, but now, as the technology advances and it gets more and more complex, a pen drive could easily store up to 120 GB and even more. 
The most impressive thing is that you wouldn’t need a large and hard to carry external hard drive – you’re capable of storing this information on a piece of plastic which is not bigger than your thumb nail.
The most common ways in which people tend to use pen drives is to carry different data from one computer device to another. 
Let’s say that you have a USB port in your car and you want to listen to some music. 
You don’t really need to spend money for expensive audio CD. 
All you need to do is upload the music on your USB drive and plug it into the car’s port and there you have it – a great way to transport from one place to another without excessive hassle.
