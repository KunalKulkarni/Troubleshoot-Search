A typical SSD uses what is called NAND-based flash memory.
This is a non-volatile type of memory. 
What does non-volatile mean you ask? The simple answer is that you can turn off the disk and it won’t “forget” what was stored on it. 
This is of course an essential characteristic of any type of permanent memory.
During the early days of SSD, rumors floated around saying stored data would wear off and be lost after only a few years.
An SSD does not have a mechanical arm to read and w data, it instead relies on an embedded processor (or “brain”) called a controller to perform a bunch of operations related to reading and writing data.
The is a very important factor in determining the speed of the SSD. 
Decisions it makes related to how to store, retrieve, cache and clean up data can determine the overall speed of the drive. 
We won’t get into the nitty-gritty details for the various tasks it performs such as error correction, read and write caching, encryption, and garbage collection to name a few. 
Yet, suffice to say, good technology is often what separates an excellent SSD from a good one.
