Cloud storage is defined as a way to store data on the Internet instead of on-premises arrays. 
It's purchased as a service and delivered on demand, so you get just-in-time capacity and costs. 
Cloud storage eliminates buying and managing your own storage infrastructure, increasing agility, providing global scale, and delivering "anywhere, anytime" data.
Cloud storage vendors build and operate infrastructure that manages capacity, security and durability to make data accessible to applications all around the world. 
Applications access cloud storage through traditional storage protocols or directly via an API. 
Many vendors offer complementary services designed to help collect, manage, and analyze data at massive scale.
